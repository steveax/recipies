Ingredients
-----------

### Cookie Dough:
- 4 ounces (1 stick or 115 grams) unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup (115 grams/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1 whole large egg
- 1/4 cup (30 grams/1 ounce) unsweetened (Dutch) cocoa powder
- 1 cup (150 grams/5.5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
- pinch of salt

### Filling:
- 4 ounces (1 stick or 115 grams) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup (125 grams/4.5 ounces) powdered Confectioner’s sugar
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened (Dutch) cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon malted drink powder (such as Ovaltine)

### Coating:
- 7 ounces (200 grams) milk chocolate (60% cocoa solids)
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil

Instructions
------------

1. Prepare the Cookies: Cream together the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy. Scrape down the bowl, add the egg and continue beating until the egg is incorporated and the mixture lightens in color. Add the cocoa powder and beat until there are no lumps. Finally, add the flour and salt on low speed until incorporated. The dough will be very soft. Turn the dough onto a piece of parchment paper on a work surface, top with another piece of parchment paper, and roll out into a large rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Put the dough on a tray and place in the freezer for 30 minutes.
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Take the dough out of the freezer and slice it into 28 small (1.25 x 2.5 inch) rectangles. Seperate the rectangles and spread them out on the lined baking trays. Bake for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
1. Make the Filling: Cream the butter until soft, sift in the remaining ingredients and beat until well combined. Spread a heaped teaspoon of filling onto half of the cookies (on the bottom side). Top with the remaining cookies, then place in the refrigerator to chill while you prepare the coating.
1. Prepare the Coating: Place the chocolate and coconut oil in a heat-proof bowl and melt together in the microwave on High (100%) in 30-second bursts, stirring well after each burst. Once the chocolate is mostly melted, remove and stir gently until smooth.
1. Take a chilled cookie and carefully coat it in the chocolate – this is easiest if you use your hands – then put it on a lined baking tray. Chill in the refrigerator, then try and stop yourself from eating them all immediately

## Notes

Unable to find ovaltine, I subbed dray malt extract which may have effected the filling consistency, but I had to add more butter to get the consistency something spreadable.
