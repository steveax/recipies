Chocolate Intrigue Cake
=======================
From Maida Heatter's Best Dessert Book Ever (Andrews & McMeel Publishing, 1997 ed.), pg. 51.

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 oz. semisweet chocolate
- 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate
- 1 TBS. dry instant expresso or coffee
- 1 1/3 cups boiling water
- 1 3/4 cups sifted unbleached flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-process)
- 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. black pepper (fine)
- 4 oz. (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs

Instructions
------------

Adjust your oven rack 1/3 from the bottom and preheat to 325 degrees.

Butter or spray two 5-cup loaf pans and dust them with chocolate bread crumbs. Just mix enough cocoa powder into regular bread crumbs to give them a dark color.

In a small saucepan or double boiler, melt both chocolates along with the expresso powder and the boiling water. Whisk it until the mixture is smooth. Transfer the mixture to a container that has a spout and can be poured from easily. Set aside to cool to lukewarm temperature.

Sift the flour, cocoa, baking powder, salt and pepper and set aside.

Beat the butter until soft and add the vanilla.

Gradually beat in the sugar.

Add the eggs, one at a time, beat until smooth.

On low speed, alternately add the flour mixture, and the chocolate mixture in two additions. Scrape the bowl as necessarily and beat until smooth.

Pour the mixture into the prepared pans.

Bake for 1 hour (or until tester comes out clean). Let cool in pans for 20 minutes, then invert on to a rack and let cool the rest of the way.
