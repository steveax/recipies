Giant Dutch Baby With Fruit
===========================

## Ingredients

- 4 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- Scant 1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1 cup (240 milliliters) whole or reduced-fat milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
- 2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter
- 10 1/2 ounces (300 grams) fresh fruit of your choice, such as mixed berries, sliced peaches or diced apple
- Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

## Directions

### Step 1

Position a baking rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees. Place an empty 9-by-13-inch pan on the rack while you prepare the batter.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar for 30 seconds, until the sugar dissolves. Add the flour, milk, vanilla and salt, whisking to form a smooth, thin batter. Set aside for 20 minutes while the oven heats up.

### Step 3

Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven and add the butter, swirling the pan until it melts and coats the bottom. Pour in the batter, sprinkle the fruit on top and bake for about 20 minutes, or until puffed and golden. The pancake will begin to deflate almost as soon as it comes out of the oven, but will largely retain its puffy edges.

### Step 4

Dust the pancake with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately.
