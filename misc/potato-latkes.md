Potato Latkes
=============

Ingredients
-----------
- 2   large Russet potatoes (about 1 pound), scrubbed and cut lengthwise into quarters
- 1   large onion (8 ounces), peeled and cut into quarters
- 2   large eggs
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2   teaspoons coarse kosher salt (or 1 teaspoon fine sea salt), plus more for sprinkling
- 1   teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- Safflower or other oil, for frying

Directions
----------

Using a food processor with a coarse grating disc, grate the potatoes
and onion. Transfer the mixture to a clean dishtowel and squeeze and
wring out as much of the liquid as possible.

Working quickly, transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the eggs,
flour, salt, baking powder and pepper, and mix until the flour is
absorbed.

In a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat, pour in about 1/4
inch of the oil. Once the oil is hot (a drop of batter placed in the pan
should sizzle), use a heaping tablespoon to drop the batter into the hot
pan, cooking in batches. Use a spatula to flatten and shape the drops
into discs. When the edges of the latkes are brown and crispy, about 5
minutes, flip. Cook until the second side is deeply browned, about
another 5 minutes. Transfer the latkes to a paper towel-lined plate to
drain and sprinkle with salt while still warm. Repeat with the remaining
batter.
