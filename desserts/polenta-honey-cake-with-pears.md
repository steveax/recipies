Polenta Honey Cake With Pears
=============================

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (125 grams) whole-wheat pastry flour or white whole-wheat flour
- 1/2 cup (80 grams) medium-ground yellow cornmeal
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
- 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing skillet
- 1/2 cup (170 grams) mild honey, such as clover or orange blossom
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
- 2 medium firm ripe pears (14 ounces/397 grams total), such as Bosc, Bartlett or Anjou
- 2 teaspoons coarse sugar, such as demerara or turbinado

## Directions

### Step 1

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees. Brush a 10-inch cast-iron or other nonstick ovenproof skillet with oil (see NOTE).

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt until combined.

### Step 3

In another medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, honey and eggs until well incorporated. Whisk in the vanilla and lemon zest, then add the flour mixture in three additions, stirring to incorporate after each.

### Step 4

Peel, halve and core one of the pears, then cut it into 1/2-inch pieces and stir it into the batter. Transfer the batter to the skillet. Halve, core and thinly slice the other pear. (You can leave the peel on if the peel is thin and tender, or you can peel the pear before slicing it.) Arrange the pear slices on top of the batter, then sprinkle with the sugar. Depending on the size of the pears, you may have a few slices left over; enjoy them as a cookâ€™s treat.

### Step 5

Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes (see NOTE), or until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cake rest in the skillet for 10 minutes or until completely cool, then cut into wedges and serve.

### Step 6

NOTE: This cake bakes faster if made in a cast-iron skillet, so if you make it in a nonstick ovenproof skillet, it may need to go the full 45 minutes.
