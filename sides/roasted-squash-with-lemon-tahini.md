Roasted Winter Squash and Red Onion With Tahini and Za’atar
===========================================================

## Ingredients

Servings: 8

- 1 medium butternut squash (1 pound 8 ounces) peeled and cut into 1-by-2 1/2-inch chunks
- 1 large red onion (8 ounces), cut into eighths
- 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons tahini, or more as needed
- 2 tablespoons water, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 small clove garlic, grated
- 3 tablespoons raw pine nuts
- 1 tablespoon za’atar
- 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling

## Directions

### Step 1

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 475 degrees.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, toss together the squash, onion, 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1 teaspoon of salt and a few twists of the pepper grinder until combined. Spread the vegetables on a large, rimmed baking sheet, leaving space among the pieces, and roast for 25 to 35 minutes, or until the vegetables have taken on some color and are cooked through with a little char. (Keep an eye on the onion: If it starts to burn before the squash is cooked, you may need to remove it and finish roasting the squash.) Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.

### Step 3

While the vegetables are roasting, in a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, water, lemon juice, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt until the sauce is the consistency of honey. You might need to add more water or tahini, depending on the consistency.

### Step 4

In a small skillet over medium-low heat, heat the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil until shimmering. Add the pine nuts and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring often until the nuts are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a small bowl.

### Step 5

To serve, spread the vegetables out on a serving platter and drizzle with the tahini sauce. Sprinkle the pine nuts and their oil on top, and garnish with the za’atar and parsley. Sprinkle with a little flaky sea salt and serve.
