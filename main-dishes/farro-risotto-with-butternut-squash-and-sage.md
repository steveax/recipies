Farro Risotto With Butternut Squash and Sage
============================================

## Ingredients

- 3 cups (about 1 pound) diced butternut squash (1/2-inch dice)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt, divided
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 medium yellow onion (8 ounces), diced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup pearled (quick-cooking) farro
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter(optional)
- 1/3 cup (about 1 ounce) grated parmesan cheese, divided
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

## Directions

### Step 1

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees.

### Step 2

On a large sheet pan, toss the squash with 1 tablespoon of the oil and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, or until tender and lightly browned in spots, tossing once at the midway point.

### Step 3

While the squash is roasting, in a small pot over medium-high heat, bring the broth to a boil. Reduce the heat to its lowest setting, cover and keep hot while you cook the farro.

### Step 4

In a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add the sage, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt and the pepper and cook, stirring, for 1 minute more. Add the farro and cook, stirring frequently, until coated in the oil and toasted, about 3 minutes.

### Step 5

Add the wine and increase the heat to high. Cook until the wine is mostly absorbed/evaporated, about 2 minutes. Ladle enough broth into the pot to just cover the farro. Lower the heat so the broth is at a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is mostly absorbed, about 5 minutes.

### Step 6

Continue to add more broth, a ladle or two at a time, ensuring the liquid is gently simmering and letting it get absorbed by the farro after each addition, until the farro is tender but still has a nice chew to it and its liquid is saucy, about 35 minutes. (You may not need all of the stock.)

### Step 7

Stir in the squash and butter, if using, and cook until the squash is warmed through and the butter is melted, about 1 minute. Stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the cheese. Add a little more stock or water if needed to maintain a thick, saucy texture.

### Step 8

Divide among shallow bowls, garnish with the remaining cheese and parsley, and serve.
