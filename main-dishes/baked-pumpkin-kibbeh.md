Baked Pumpkin Kibbeh
====================

(makes 10 to 12 servings)

## Outer Layer

- 2 cups bulgur wheat (size #1), soaked in enough cold water to cover for 30 minutes
- 2 cups fresh or canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie mix)
- ½ onion, pureed into liquid using a food processor
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup unseasoned breadcrumbs
- 1 tablespoon Hot Pepper Paste (page 212)
- 1½ tablespoons Tanoreen Kibbie Spice Mix
or
- 1 tablespoon ground allspice
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon dried marjoram
- Sea salt

## Stuffing

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 5 cups packed baby spinach leaves (or other green, chard works well, about 1 1/2 - 2 large bunches)
- 1 cup diced onion
- ½ cup diced shallots (or additional onion)
- 1 cup cooked chickpeas, fresh or canned
- 1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts (pine nuts and hazelnuts also work well)
- ½ cup packed chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1 tablespoon sumac
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
- Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)
- Sea salt
- ½ cup olive oil, for greasing and brushing


## Make the outer layer

In a large bowl, combine the soaked bulgur, pumpkin, pureed onion, flour, bread- crumbs, hot pepper paste, and the kibbie spice mix and season with salt. Dip your hands in a bowl of ice water to keep them moist and mix until the mixture has a workable dough texture that holds its shape when pressed. Divide into two equal pieces.

## Make the stuffing
Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the spinach leaves and cook, stirring once or twice, until they just begin to wilt, about 2 minutes. Pour the spinach into a colander and use your hands to squeeze any excess liquid out.

Place the spinach in a large bowl and add the remaining stuffing ingredients. Stir well to combine.

## Make the kibbie

- Preheat the oven to 400.
- Grease a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with ¼ cup of the oil.
- Take half the kibbie shell and roll it into a ball.

Place the ball in the middle of the pan and start spreading it with your hands (dipping them into the ice water as needed), until the mixture evenly covers the bottom of the pan and partially up the sides.

Spread the spinach stuffing in an even layer on top of the kibbie shell.

Pinch off pieces of the remaining kibbie shell dough and roll them into balls. Pat the balls into about ½-inch thickness (remember to keep your hands moist) and evenly distribute them on top of the stuffing. Use your wet fingers to close the gaps between the dough so there is an even, flat layer of kibbie shell on top of the stuffing.

Brush the kibbie with the remaining ¼ cup oil and score into triangles, rectangles, or squares, cutting only through the top layer of the shell. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 250°F and bake for 15 more minutes, or until golden brown. Cut along the scored lines to serve
