Pumpkin Pasta With Bacon and Goat Cheese
========================================

## Ingredients

- Fine salt
- 8 ounces medium dried pasta, such as fusilli or rotini
- 8 ounces bacon (6 to 8 slices), cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 small yellow onion (5 ounces), diced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
- 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
- 4 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated
- 1 cup canned pumpkin puree
- 4 ounces fresh goat cheese (ch√®vre)

## Directions

### Step 1

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the pasta.

### Step 2

To a cold, large (12-inch) nonstick skillet or saute pan over medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook, stirring frequently, until the fat is rendered and the bacon browns and crisps, 7 to 10 minutes. While the bacon is cooking, line a large plate with paper towels and set it near your workspace. Carefully transfer the bacon to the prepared plate with a slotted spoon. Pour the fat into a heatproof bowl or measuring cup, then return 2 tablespoons to the skillet. (Reserve the rest of the bacon fat for another use.)

### Step 3

Add the onion, thyme, pepper and allspice to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion starts to soften and turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

### Step 4

Reduce the heat to low; add the pumpkin puree, goat cheese, cooked pasta and 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water; and stir until evenly combined, adding more pasta cooking water if the sauce is too thick. Remove from the heat. Taste, and season with salt and pepper, as desired. Divide the pasta among bowls, sprinkle with the cooked bacon and serve warm.
